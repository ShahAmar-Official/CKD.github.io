      <h1>Research Overview</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        This research explores how ECG-derived indicators can assist in early detection
        and risk stratification of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Conducted by Shah Amar,
        the study leverages supervised learning in WEKA and structured data from the CKD ML Repository.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The workflow begins with ECG feature engineering, extracting time-domain and morphology-based
        metrics relevant to cardiac rhythm and waveform stability. These features are standardized
        and mapped to CKD-related labels from the dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple classifiers in WEKA are evaluated, with emphasis on interpretability and
        generalization performance across folds. Evaluation includes accuracy, precision,
        recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <ul class="timeline">
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Dataset acquisition and preprocessing</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> ECG feature extraction and normalization</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Model training and cross-validation in WEKA</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Result analysis and marker reporting</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Visualization and dissemination</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        ECG-derived features provide meaningful signals for CKD classification.
        Waveform irregularities and rhythm-based features showed higher importance
        across evaluated models.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        Planned expansions include signal-level deep learning, multi-modal biomarker integration,
        and validation on larger cohorts. Real-time monitoring and cloud-based analytics are also planned.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        Collaboration is welcome with researchers, clinicians, and data scientists
        working on biosignal analysis or healthcare AI. Visit the Contact page to connect.
